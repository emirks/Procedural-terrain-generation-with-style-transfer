# Procedural-terrain-generation-with-style-transfer

In this study we introduce a new technique for the generation of terrain maps, exploiting a com-
bination of procedural generation and Neural Style Transfer. We consider our approach to be
a viable alternative to competing generative models, with our technique achieving greater ver-
satility, lower hardware requirements and greater integration in the creative process of designers
and developers. Our method involves generating procedural noise maps using either multi-layered
smoothed Gaussian noise or the Perlin algorithm. We then employ an enhanced Neural Style
transfer technique, drawing style from real-world height maps. This fusion of algorithmic gen-
eration and neural processing holds the potential to produce terrains that are not only diverse
but also closely aligned with the morphological characteristics of real-world landscapes, with our
process yielding consistent terrain structures with low computational cost and offering the capa-
bility to create customized maps. Numerical evaluations further validate our modelâ€™s enhanced
ability to accurately replicate terrain morphology, surpassing traditional procedural methods.

## Code will be released in the next few days, sorry for the delay
